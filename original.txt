If plaintext is stored in a computer file , the
storage media, the computer and its components, and all backups must
be secure. Sensitive data is sometimes processed on computers
whose mass storage is removable, in which case physical security of
the removed disk is vital. In the case of securing a computer,
useful (as opposed to handwaving) security must be physical (e.g.,
against burglary, brazen removal under cover of supposed repair,
installation of covert monitoring devices, etc.), as well as
virtual (e.g., operating system modification, illicit network
access, Trojan programs). Wide availability of keydrives, which can
plug into most modern computers and store large quantities of data,
poses another severe security headache. A spy (perhaps posing as
a cleaning person) could easily conceal one, and even swallow it
if necessary.
